# Feature extraction pipeline

The feature extraction pipeline to study vascular cell dynamics and more. 
This instruction is for installing the feature extraction algorithm only. How to 
install the app to visualize results is explained [here](https://github.com/wgiese/vascu-ec-app) or
if you cloned the whole project and now look at this instructions visit [this file](../README.md).  

## Install the feature extraction pipeline:

- Install via pip:
    - clone https://github.com/wgiese/vascu-ec-app via git or download via browser
    - change to the base directory
    - run `pip install -e vascu_ec`
    
## Execute the feature extraction pipeline

- from the commandline:
    - run `vascu_ec` to obtain further help on how to start a feature extraction process
    - run `vascu_ec_test` to run the provided test suit and check your installation
