```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown


```{read_data}
filepath <- "/home/wgiese/Data/Olya/070621/features/image001_.csv"
ec_features <- read.csv(file = filepath)
summary(ec_features)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#print(filepath)
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
